# Solution Overview
## `utils.h` and `asset.h`

I began by implementing the functions declared in these two header files. At this stage, there were no major difficulties or edge cases worth mentioning, so thereâ€™s nothing specific to discuss here.

### First challenge
I'm encountering a challenge with the `delete_asset` function. Due to some past miscommunication or oversight in task planning, `delete_asset` currently needs to interact with the `UserRecord` list, but it doesn't have a way to access it. I've decided to postpone completing `delete_asset` until after I've finished working on `users.c`.

For now, I'm considering a few temporary design options to allow `delete_asset` to access the `UserRecord` list, even though I know I'll need to refine this approach later for a better, more permanent solution:

- Make the `UserRecord` list (specifically its head pointer) a global variable. This would allow `delete_asset` to directly access it from `assets.c`.

- Move the `UserRecord` struct definition into `assets.h`. This would technically make the `UserRecord` struct visible to `assets.c`, but it doesn't solve the problem of accessing the list instance itself.

- Move the `delete_asset` function (or at least its user-related logic) into `users.c` or a more centralized place. This would mean the users module would handle asset reference removal.

I recognize these are temporary workarounds, and I'll need to revisit the overall design for how these two modules (assets and users) interact to ensure `delete_asset` can correctly remove user references in a clean and modular way.
