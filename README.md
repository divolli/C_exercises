🧠 C Practice Exercises — Learn by Doing

Welcome to this repository!
If you're a student struggling with C programming — especially with memory allocation, pointer logic, and understanding what your code is really doing — you're in the right place.
📚 What is this?

This is a growing collection of carefully crafted C exercises designed to help you:

    Get better at memory management and dynamic allocation

    Understand pointers, structs, and how memory works in C

    Develop problem-solving skills and coding confidence

The exercises are written in .md files, located in the exercises/ folder.
💡 How to use it

Treat this as your personal mini-project. These aren't just quick drills — they’re challenges meant to make you think.

Here’s how I recommend you approach them:

    Read each task carefully.

    Try to solve it step by step on your own.

    Use AI as a mentor, not a crutch:

        Ask for explanations, not code.

        Ask for hints, not solutions.

        Ask "why" and "how", not "give me".

❗ DO NOT COPY-PASTE AI CODE.
If you do that, you're not solving the problem — you're skipping the learning. And honestly, you'll learn nothing.
🙋 Why should you trust this?

I'm a student myself. I know how confusing C can be.
So I'm going through the same journey — and I'm publishing my own solutions in the solutions/ folder as soon as I complete them.
They’re not perfect, but that’s the point. You’ll see how another student thinks and solves.

    Learning by doing is the only way to really understand C. No shortcuts, just progress.

🔧 Requirements

Any Linux environment or compiler (e.g. gcc, clang) will do.
Use whatever editor or IDE you're comfortable with — VSCode, Neovim, etc.
