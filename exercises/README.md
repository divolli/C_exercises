Of course, you can approach these tasks in any order you prefer, but I designed them to gradually increase in difficulty. So, here’s my personal recommendation on the order to tackle them.

**Recommended order:**

1. Galactic Wars
    
2. Digital Resource Management System in C
    
3. Tasks and Resource Scheduling Management System in C
    
4. Book and Author Collection Management System in C
    
5. Memory Manager

I also encourage you to use AI tools—especially if you don’t have a C-programmer friend to ask. However, treat AI as a mentor: someone who explains concepts and helps you understand the problems. **Do not copy code or ask for ready-made solutions.** It’s important to think through the challenges yourself. The initial phase might feel tough and take some time until things click in your mind, but that’s exactly where the learning happens. So, I strongly recommend independent thinking and problem-solving :)
