## **Task Guidelines: Galactic War History Management System**

Your goal is to implement an advanced system for managing data about galactic battles, with a strong focus on complex memory management, pointer operations, and bitwise manipulations.

---

### **Key Requirements**

#### **Data Structures**

You must implement **four main data structures** as described below:

- `struct fleet_status_t`:
    Contains **bit-coded status flags**, the **number of ships**, and the **fleet name**.

- `struct battle_t`:
    Contains the **battle name**, **date**, and an **array of pointers** to `struct fleet_status_t`.

- `struct battle_node_t`:
    A **doubly-linked list node** that stores a pointer to `struct battle_t`.

- `struct galaxy_history_t`:
    The **main structure**, which contains **pointers to the head and tail** of the battle list, as well as the **total number of battles**.


---

### **Memory and Pointer Management**

- ‚ùå **No `[]` operator**:
    Wherever possible, you must use **pointer arithmetic** instead of the indexing operator `[]`.

- üì¶ **Dynamic allocation**:
    All `char*` fields (e.g., `fleet_name`, `battle_name`) must be **dynamically allocated** using functions like `strdup()` or `malloc()` + `strcpy()`.

- üß© **Nested allocation**:
    Memory must be allocated on **multiple levels**:

    - for `galaxy_history_t`,

    - for each `battle_node_t`,

    - for each `battle_t`,

    - for the **array of fleet_status pointers** in `battle_t`,

    - and finally for each individual `fleet_status_t`.

- üîö **NULL termination**:
    The array of `fleet_status_t*` pointers in `battle_t` **must end with a NULL pointer** ‚Äî this is essential for proper iteration over fleets.

- üéØ **Exact allocation**:
    Your data loading function must allocate **only as much memory as needed**, minimizing overallocation (e.g., by using `realloc()` after filling the array).

- üßπ **Memory cleanup**:
    The function `destroy_galactic_history` must **free all allocated memory** across all levels of the data structure.
    This is the **most important part** to avoid memory leaks.
    It must also **work correctly even in case of partial data load** (e.g., after an error).


---

### **Parsing Data from File (`galactic_data.txt`)**

The file contains data about **battles**, their **dates**, and **fleets**.
The format is specific:

- Lines begin with `BATTLE:`, `DATE:`, and `FLEET:` (details were provided earlier).

- Each `FLEET:` line contains:

    - fleet name,

    - base status flag value (numeric),

    - number of ships,

    - and **verbal descriptions of additional status flags**, separated by `|`.


You must correctly **map these verbal descriptions to bits**, and set the appropriate bits in the `status_flags` field (in addition to the base numeric value).

#### **Mapping verbal status to bits:**

|Description|Bit|Value|
|---|---|---|
|`Ready_for_Jump`|0|1|
|`Shields_Active`|1|2|
|`Critical_Damage`|2|4|
|`Withdrawal`|3|8|

---

### **Function Implementation**

You must implement **all declared functions**, including:

- `initialize_history` ‚Äì Initializes the main structure.

- `load_galactic_history` ‚Äì Loads data from the file and builds the full data structure (a list of battles with arrays of fleets).
    Includes **robust error handling** (allocation errors, file corruption, etc.).

- `display_galactic_history` ‚Äì Displays the contents of the entire data structure.

- `count_fleets_with_status_bits` ‚Äì Bitwise function: counts fleets with specified status bits.

- `modify_fleet_statuses_in_battle` ‚Äì Bitwise function: modifies fleet statuses in a given battle using `OR`, `AND NOT`, `XOR` operations with a bitmask.

- `destroy_galactic_history` ‚Äì A key function that frees **all allocated memory**.


---

### **Task Goals**

The main goal is to demonstrate your skills in:

- Designing and implementing **complex nested data structures**.

- **Precise dynamic memory management** (allocation, reallocation, freeing) at multiple levels.

- Efficient usage of **pointers and pointer arithmetic**.

- Implementing **bitwise operations**.

- Writing **robust error handling**, especially for memory allocation failures.
